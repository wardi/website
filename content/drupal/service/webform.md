## Introduction

One of the major services the `Open Data Platform` provides is the ability to
quickly solving the challenges of creating smart, content rich,
maintainable customer facing forms through a rich and intuitive user interface.
All of the generated form submissions are fully accessible and strictly adhere
to `WET-BOEW` guidelines for the `GCWeb` theme along with all the others.

## Webform

Arguably one of the most popular modules in the Drupal eco-system. The `Webform`
module has seen a dramatic redesign and improvement in the Drupal 8 release.
This contributed module with minimal extensions powers the bulk of all
submissions throughout the Open Data portal. Whether you are creating petitions,
personalized contact forms, or even complicated multi-step surveys they are all
supported.

* Build / maintain webforms through a rich user interface
* Create a new form or reproduce an existing pattern
* Collect submissions
* Send notifications and confirmations
* Rate submissions
* Review submissions online
* Download submissions as either `CSV` / `XLS` / `JSON`
* Upload submissions through `API` / `CSV`
* Essential statistical inference
